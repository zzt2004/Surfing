## Wiki

<details>
<summary>1. First Use</summary>

- After installing the module, you don't need to restart the device. You can use the `Toolbox` integration to refresh the update status of the client
- Add the subscription address in `config.yaml` and reload the configuration.
- Due to network reasons, all rules may not be downloaded automatically. Please manually update/download the rule files.
  - If the above fails, ensure your network environment is normal.
- Web App: [Download](https://github.com/MoGuangYu/Surfing/raw/main/folder/Web_v5.5_release.apk) | [View Source Code](./folder/main.lua)
  - This is a graphical auxiliary tool for convenient browsing and managing backend routing data, with no additional purposes.

> The module has a built-in GUI that can be accessed locally via a browser or used online with the app, with no essential difference between the two.

<summary>5. Usage Issues</summary>

1. Proxy Specific Applications (Black/Whitelist)
- To proxy all applications except certain ones, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, set the `proxy_mode` value to `blacklist` (default), and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array. The format for elements is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces. For example, `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")` to **not proxy** specific Android user applications.

- To only proxy specific applications, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, set the `proxy_mode` value to `whitelist`, and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array. The format for elements is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces. For example, `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")` to **only proxy** specific Android user applications.

Android user group ID identifiers:

| Standard User | ID  |
| ------------- | --- |
| Owner         |  0  |
| Second Space  |  10 |
| App Clone     | 999 |

> Typically, you can find all user group IDs and application package names in `/data/user/`. Do not use fake-ip mode when using black/whitelist.

2. Tun Mode
- Enabled by default

> It is recommended to keep it enabled. It can be disabled if not needed, but do not use black/white lists when this mode is enabled.

3. Routing Rules
- Bypass mainland China
- It basically meets the needs of most daily usage.

> Black/whitelist is not significant unless strictly required. The module's built-in configuration is sufficient.

4. Panel Management
- Magisk Font Module

> May affect normal display of page fonts.

5. LAN Sharing
- Enable hotspot to allow other devices to connect.

> For other devices to access the console backend, just use (http://currentWiFigateway:9090/ui).
