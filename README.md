## Wiki

<details>
<summary>1. Firsttime Usage</summary>

- After successfully adding the subscription address, restart your phone. The complete rule files may not be automatically downloaded due to network issues. Manually navigate to the rule page at the bottom right of the proxy page on the Web App and click the refresh icon to update/download rule files. If you cant use the app due to network issues, please copy and open it in a browser:
  - `127.0.0.1:9090/ui`
  - If the above fails, try switching the module on and make sure your network environment is normal.
- Web App official: [Download](https://github.com/MoGuangYu/Surfing/raw/main/folder/Web_v5.5_release.apk) | [View Source Code](./folder/main.lua)
  - It is only a graphical tool for portable browsing and managing backend routing data, with no other additional uses.

> The module has a built-in GUI that can be accessed locally through a browser or online using the app. There is essentially no difference between the two.

<summary>2. Control Operation</summary>

- You can enable or disable real-time control of the running service through the module switch.
</details>

#

<details>
<summary>3. Script Updates</summary>

- UpdateGeo.sh script is used to update Geo database files in one click and requires the curl command. Please make sure you have already installed the curl command before running the script, and execute the following commands in the terminal one by one:
  - `pkg update`
  - `pkg install curl`
- If there are selective prompts during the installation process, select "Y" and press Enter.
- Termux App official: [Download](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk)

> About the Geo database: GitHub Actions automatically builds it at 6 a.m. Beijing time every day to ensure the latest rules. It is used for routing rule matching to achieve precise diversion. The scripts updates will permanently point to the latest version, so youcan manually update it once a month.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Subsequent Updates</summary>

- Supports online module updates in Magisk Manager.
- No need to restart after the update, the service takes effect in real time.

- During the update, the old user configuration files will be backed up to:
   - `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config.bak`
- Module updates will not include updates to database files:
   - geoip.dat, geosite.dat, country.mmdb

<summary>5. Usage Issues</summary>

I. Proxy Specific Applications (Blacklist/Whitelist)
- If you want to proxy all applications except specific ones, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, change the value of `proxy_mode` to `blacklist` (default), and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array. The format of array elements is `id identifier: app package name`, separated by spaces. This will make the module **not proxy** the respective Android apps. For example: `user_packages_list=("id identifier: app package name" "id identifier: app package name")`

- If you only want to proxy specific applications, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, change the value of `proxy_mode` to `whitelist`, and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array in the same format. This will make the module **only proxy** the respective Android apps. For example: `user_packages_list=("id identifier: app package name" "id identifier: app package name")`

Android User Group Identifiers:

| Standard User | ID  |
| -------- | --- |
| Owner     |  0  |
| Second Space | 10  |
| Clone Apps | 999 |

> You can typically find all user group identifiers and app package names in `/data/user/` on your device. Avoid using the fake IP mode with blacklists/whitelists.

II. Tun Mode
- Disabled by default

> Not recommended for general use unless you have special requirements. Do not use blacklists/whitelists with this mode.

III. Routing Rules
- For bypassing China mainland.
- The rules are maintained by the developer and can satisfy most usage needs.

> Unless you have very strict requirements, blacklists/whitelists may not be very meaningful. You can use the modules built-in configuration.

IV. LAN Sharing
- Enable hotspot and let other devices connect.

> If other devices want to access the console backend, just use http://currentWiFiGateway:9090/ui
